LORE

Years ago, the Skellytown graveyard was one of the most populated cemeteries around. It happened to reside next to a nuclear power plant, which, unfortunately (or fortunately.. ) underwent a meltdown. Nuclear waste spilled all over the town of Skellytown, including the Skellytown graveyard. 

Everyone in Skellytown was killed, but interestingly, something happened to the ones that were already dead. Boney hands emerged from the graves, and out rose the skellys you know today.

The skellys don't like to stand out, and they just wanted to restart their life with society. To blend in they don sunglasses, chains, hats, and more. Some even wear costumes, such as the Matrix skelly, or the Lich skelly. To this day, the skellys remain a community that gathers for survival. Some skellys are even sent on adventures to retrieve treasure, pets, and more!
